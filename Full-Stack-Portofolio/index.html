<!-- Description
Today we are building a portfolio site for ourselves
These types of sites use links to help visitors navigate the site

Instructions
- Create all the sections you see in the example image. Make sure to click on open original after opening the image to be able to see all the details
- Create internal links to simple portfolio pages
- Create external links to GitHub and/or CodeSandbox
- Create anchor links to navigate to different sections of the page
- Focus on building a website with navigation first; styling second

Tips
- Remember you don't have to always use grid to create layouts. Use the default page flow to your advantage
- Use grid to get the right layout in the header
- Use scroll-behaviour: smooth for a better user experience

Challenge 1
- Make the website responsive -->
